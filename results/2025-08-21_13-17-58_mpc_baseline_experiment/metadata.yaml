  description: "\n        This is a baseline, zero-shot experiment designed to test\
    \ the model's intrinsic response to a marginal propensity to consume (MPC) scenario.\n\
    \        The experiment uses a generic SimpleHousehold agent, providing no context\
    \ or narrative. The prompt is a direct question asking the household how to allocate\
    \ an unexpected windfall between spending and saving. The model is not prompted\
    \ for reasoning, only for the final allocation amounts. The objective is to establish\
    \ a foundational benchmark for the openai/gpt-oss-20b model's inherent economic\
    \ priors before introducing more complex variables.\n        "

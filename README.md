# AI Household
Implementation of the AI household, abstracting a lot of the wrapper, api, etc logic which is required to interact with the LLMs. 

## Core concept

> Create notebooks where We test the AI household against a series of behavioral micro foundations results

Tests:

- Response to small windfalls
- Response to govt. stimulus (tax rebate studies)
- 1st order: heterogeneity across liquid wealth & hand to mouth status
- Response of consumption to a permanent income shock (anticipated & unanticipated)
- Wealth Effect: Consumption response to wealth shocks (seperate out housing & financial?)
- Labour supply elasticities: Frisch in particular
- Behavioral test: quantifying present bias. For both monetary and effort rewards.
- Behavioral test: measuring loss aversion in financial decisions

## Test 1: Response to small windfalls

1. Marginal propensity to consume: the response to an increase in liquid funds. There are three or four seminal studies in this literature. Response to a small unanticipated windfall. See Havranek & Sokolova (2020) & Jappelli & Pistaferri (2010).

2. Marginal propensity to consume: derivative over income and over wealth
